[cn/compute_N_leached.c:206]: (error) Uninitialized variable: navail
> fixed, was just missing an ititialization

[cycle/patch_daily_F.c:754]: (error) Uninitialized variable: tmpustar
> fixed, these aren't in the multiscale branch, I copeied the change Ryan made there and commpented out a section that looks like Aubrey had it as dummy/temp code

[init/construct_basin.c:430]: (error) Uninitialized variable: routing_file
> fixed(i think), moved l430 to l414, fclose(routing_file) was outside of the routing IF where routing file is assinged

[init/construct_dated_clim_sequence.c:276]: (error) Resource leak: sequence_file
> fixed, was missing fclose

[init/construct_stream_routing_topology.c:262]: (error) Resource leak: stream_file
[init/construct_stream_routing_topology.c:262]: (error) Resource leak: reservoir_file
> fixed missing fclose()

[init/construct_surface_energy_defaults.c:140]: (error) Used file that is not opened.
[init/construct_surface_energy_defaults.c:140]: (error) Uninitialized variable: default_file
> fixed (commented out) var and a fclose() of that var are old, looks like from before read by tag

[init/construct_world.c:671]: (error) Resource leak: grid_base
> fixed, missing fclose

[rad/compute_diffuse_radiative_PAR_fluxes.c:129]: (error) printf format string requires 4 parameters but only 3 are given.

[cn/compute_potential_N_uptake_combined.c:156]: (error) Uninitialized variable: c_allometry
> isn't intiialized - looks like it's missing and needs to be copied from base version of compute_potential_N_uptake

[init/construct_basin.c:416]: (error) Uninitialized variable: hillslope
> seems to be fine - unclear why the error

[init/construct_canopy_strata.c:302]: (error) Uninitialized variable: spinup_default_object_ID
> init is inside IF for spinup, parsing won't use default so it shouldn't ever be a problem, but could also fix by intializing to -9999 (?)
> check w Naomi or Erin

[init/construct_fire_grid.c:341]: (error) Uninitialized variable: fire_grid
[init/construct_fire_gridLegacy.c:231]: (error) Uninitialized variable: fire_grid
> these seem fine, it's allocated inside an IF, and the else option doesnt assign anything to fire_grid, but it would error anyways
> could fix by setting fire_grid to null inside the else at line 281 (maybe i think)

[init/construct_patch.c:439]: (error) Uninitialized variable: surface_energy_default_object_ID
> needs fixing I think - unclear how it's supposed to be intialized, but see line 141
